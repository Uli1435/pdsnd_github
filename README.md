### Project Title
Explore US Bike share data.

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and
popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to
rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to
borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return
it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each
bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the
system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These
technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these
bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, the user can use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system
provider in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns for the
following three major cities. Chicago, New York City and Washington. The data are
randomly selected for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities.The user
can learn the patterns the users used the bikes in these three cities by seeing
the duration of the trips, the time the users started and ended the trips, most
popular stations, user info and many more!

With this data users can make a "picture" of what the pattern of rending a bike
in these three cities is.
